# Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

+ is a software development principle, the main aim of which is to reduce repetition of code.

+ it means don’t write the same code repeatedly. Suppose you are having the same code at many places in your program, then It is known as DRY, You are repeating the same code repeatedly at different places

## Alternatives :

+ WET :

   Write Everything Twice (WET) is a cheeky abbreviation to mean the opposite i.e. code that doesn’t adhere to DRY principle.

+ AHA :

   tands for "Avoid Hasty Abstractions" ,its mean prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction and optimize for change first


## Rule of three (computer programming)

+ Sometimes called “1, 2, refactor” ,its a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when a replicated piece of code should be replaced by a new procedure. 

+ Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior

+ It states that you are allowed to copy and paste the code once, but that when the same code is replicated three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.

## You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)

+ Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.

+ There are two main reasons to practise YagNi:

   1- You save time, because you avoid writing code that you turn out not to need.

   2- Your code is better, because you avoid polluting it with 'guesses' that turn out to be more or less wrong but stick around anyway.

   ## minimum viable product (MVP)

   + is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle.

   + It is the version of a new product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least amount of effort.

   + Purposes:

     - test a product hypothesis with minimal resources.

     - Accelerate learning

     - Reduce wasted hours

     - Get the product to early customers as soon as possible

     - Base for other products
