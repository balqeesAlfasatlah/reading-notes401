# Stacks and Queues

+ Stack :inear data structure that is used to store the collection of objects. It is based on Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)

+ The stack data structure has the two most important operations that are

   1- **push** : The push operation inserts an element into the stack
   
  2- **pop** : removes an element from the top of the stack

+ Queue : is a linear data structure or a collection in Java that stores elements in a FIFO (First In, First Out) order.

+ a queue is a structure having two points , start (front) and end (rear). Elements are inserted into the queue at the rear end and removed from the queue at the front.

+ the queue data structure has important operations that are :

   1- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

   2- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

   3- Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.

   4- Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

   5- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

   6- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
