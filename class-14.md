# Trees

+ **Trees** : are a collection of nodes (vertices), and they are linked with edges (pointers), representing the hierarchical connections between the nodes.

+ Common Terminology :

    + **Node**:  a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes

    + **Root**:  is the node at the beginning of the tree

    + **K - A** : number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have .

    + **Left** : reference to one child node, in a binary tree.

    + **Right** : reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

    + **Edge** :is the link between a parent and child node

    + **Leaf** : is a node that does not have any children

    + **Heigh** : is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

2- **Breadth First :**

traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.
