# Object-Oriented Programming

## OOP : is a methodology to design a program using calsses and objects.

1- **Class** : a templete or blueprint for the objects.

+ Declaring Classes :

+ Declaring Member Variables : there is serveral kinds of variables:

+ Access Modifiers : to control what other classes have access to a member field. 

   **public modifier**—the field is accessible from all classes.

   **private modifier**—the field is accessible only within its own class.

2- Object : is an excutable copy of class .

3- Interface : is a contract between a class and the outside world.

4- package : is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner.

5- Inheritance  : a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent .

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

1- Decimal :
Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which:

2- Bases :
The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9

3- Binary Numbers : its 
"Base 2" i So we start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits.

4- Hexadecimal Numbers : base 16 , They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.
