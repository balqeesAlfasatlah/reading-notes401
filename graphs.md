# Graphs


+ graph : is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.


+ terminology used when working with Graphs:

   1- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

   2- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

   3- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

   4- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.


+ **Undirected Graphs** : is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional (the undirected graph does not move in any direction)

+ **Directed Graph** : also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

+ The three different types types of graphs :

  1- completed

  2- connected

  3- disconnected.

+ Acyclic vs Cyclic :

+ **Graph Representation**
We represent graphs through:

  1- Adjacency Matrix
   
  2- Adjacency List
