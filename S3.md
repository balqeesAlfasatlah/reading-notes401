## How Amazon S3 works 

+ Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. 

+ An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects.

+ To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region.

+ Then, you upload your data to that bucket as objects in Amazon S3.

+ Each object has a key (or key name), which is the unique identifier for the object within the bucket.

+ S3 provides features that you can configure to support your specific use case.

+ For example, you can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket, which allows you to restore objects that are accidentally deleted or overwritten.

+ Buckets and the objects in them are private and can be accessed only if you explicitly grant access permissions. 

+ You can use bucket policies, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, access control lists (ACLs), and S3 Access Points to manage access.
