# Packages and Import & Loops in Java

+ Package = directory.
+ Java classes can be grouped together in packages. A package name is the same as the directory (folder) name.
+ **Package declaration** : 

1- The first statement in a Java source file, must be the package declaration.
 
 2- Package declaration syntax :

 - Package statment (optional).
 - Imports (optional).
 - Class or interface definitions.

**Does importing all classes in a package make my object file (.class or .jar) larger?**

No, import only tells the compiler where to look for symbols.

**Is the order of the imports important?**

 No. Group them for readability.
